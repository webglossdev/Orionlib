This repo stores some of the scripts and the script hub which uses them that i made with the OrionLib Ui Library and Lua.

The scripts which i made are inside the MY-HUBS folder, the other scripts are the ones inside the hub and are not made by me.

You can do anything with the code however you like.

Be warned that you should not use my hubs with any sort of roblox exploit/executor inside public instances as it is against Roblox's TOS and will get you banned, use it on your own private server and games.

This project is no longer being maintaned as long as 12/2025. I don't have interest on maintaining this as i don't play or build games for roblox as often as i did before.
